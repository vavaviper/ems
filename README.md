# Employee Management System

The Employee Management System is a robust CRUD RESTful API built using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate. This project showcases the powerful combination of these technologies to create a scalable and efficient backend solution.

##Technologies Used

    Spring Boot: Streamlines the development of Spring applications through convention-over-configuration, allowing for rapid development and a focus on business logic rather than setup.

    PostgreSQL: Utilized as the relational database system for its advanced capabilities, including reliable transactions and concurrent access management.

    Spring Data JPA: Facilitates the implementation of JPA-based repositories, simplifying data access and management in the relational database.

    Hibernate: Handles object-relational mapping, managing the data operations such as create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) with ease, thanks to its robust ORM capabilities.

##Features

    Comprehensive CRUD Operations: Provides full support for create, read, update, and delete operations through a well-defined API.
    Database Integration: Utilizes PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and management.
    Enhanced Data Access: Leverages Spring Data JPA for simplified data interactions.
    Efficient ORM: Employs Hibernate for seamless object-relational mapping.
