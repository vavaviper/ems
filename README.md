# Employee Management System

The **Employee Management System** is a robust CRUD RESTful API built using Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate. This project demonstrates the effective integration of these technologies to create a scalable and efficient backend solution.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot**: Streamlines the development of Spring applications with a convention-over-configuration approach, enabling rapid development and a focus on business logic rather than setup.
- **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database system used for its advanced capabilities, including reliable transactions and concurrent access management.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Facilitates the implementation of JPA-based repositories, simplifying data access and management within the relational database.
- **Hibernate**: Handles object-relational mapping (ORM) to manage data operations such as create, retrieve, update, and delete (CRUD) with efficiency and ease.

## Features

- **Comprehensive CRUD Operations**: Full support for create, read, update, and delete operations through a well-defined API.
- **Database Integration**: Utilizes PostgreSQL for reliable data storage and management.
- **Enhanced Data Access**: Leverages Spring Data JPA for streamlined data interactions.
- **Efficient ORM**: Employs Hibernate for seamless object-relational mapping.
